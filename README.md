## How To Use This App

This is the main screen of the app. The vertical bar is scrollable and contains character portraits, which are buttons. Tap any of the buttons to initiate a search for that specific character. Results returned are limited to the last 24 hours, and are sorted from newest to oldest. Tapping on another character button will clear the search results and start a new search. To watch a video, simply tap the video or the text next to it - you will need some way of watching YouTube videos, such as through your browser or the YouTube app.

## Selecting Your Favorite Characters
